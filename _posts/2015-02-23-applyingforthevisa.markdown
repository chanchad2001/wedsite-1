There are a number of options available to transatlantic couples wishing to get married, I should know because I've asked and read about them all. We ruled out getting married on a tourist visa (technically visa fraud) and getting married in the UK (not feasible due to Sarah's job), which leaves us with the bureaucratic process of petitioning for a K1 Fiancee visa. 


A K1 Fiancee Visa will allows an alien (that's me) to enter the country and stay for 90 days, much like a tourist visa, however with the condition that if we get married within those 90 days this visa can be levelled up permanent resident.

The application requires preparing an I-129 packet, which is a whole mess of forms and evidence that we've met in person in the past two years.
