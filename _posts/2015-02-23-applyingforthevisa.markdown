There are a number of options available to transatlantic couples wishing to get married, I should know because I've asked and read about them all! We ruled out getting married on a tourist visa (technically visa fraud) and getting married in the UK (not feasible due to Sarah's job), which leaves us with the bureaucratic process of petitioning for a K1 Fiancee visa. 

A K1 Fianc√© Visa will allows an alien (that's me) to enter the country and stay for 90 days, much like a tourist visa, however with the condition that if we get married within those 90 days this visa can be levelled up to allow permanent resident.

The application requires preparing an I-129 packet, which is a whole mess of forms and evidence that our relationship is real and we've met in person in the past two years. Some time soon, I'll need to complete medical and background checks and have an interview at the US Embassy in London.

If everything goes well, this process should take 5-6 months so just in time for our wedding...
