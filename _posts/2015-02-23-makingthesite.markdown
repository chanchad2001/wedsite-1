As soon as we started planning our wedding we knew we’d want to keep everyone updated using with our own website. There’s a ton of services that will sell you pre-built wedding sites but being a geek I wanted to make our own.

I ruled using Wordpress, Django or Drupal because that’d mean organising ’proper’ hosting and more complications than I was willing to deal with.

Then I found [Jeykll](www.http://jekyllrb.com "Jeykll"), a really neat static site generator. Being static files I could host it easily on my AWS account and as it uses Markdown for it’s content there’d be no CMS or HTML for Sarah to learn. After a few lines in terminal, I was up and running :)

So far, it’s been really easy to work with I’ve made some customisations and had to brush up on my CSS skills to ensure images are responsive. Since I’m using Github for version control, it’s been super easy (and free) to host using [Github Pages] (https://pages.github.com "Github Pages"). This has been a fun little project, although I design web applications for a living I rarely get a chance to code anything beyond simple prototypes so I've enjoyed making something almost from scratch.
