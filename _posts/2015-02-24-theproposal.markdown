![The Bandstand]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/bandstand.jpg)

I'd known for a while that Sarah was 'the one' and earlier this year I decided that it was about time I did something about it. We'd already arranged that she'd be visiting London in mid February, so I set about finding the perfect ring.


My research included visiting several jewellers in Hatton Gardens, the diamond district of London and hours spent researching diamonds and rings online. I considered Sarah's work and sought something practical yet unique. I eventually settled on a tension style ring and a short list of jewellers, after a few more questions and some good customer service I customised and ordered the ring. 


Just a few days later, Sarah arrived at Heathrow after a restless red-eye flight. I had to contain my excitement and tried my best to be patient as Sarah napped. Eventually I managed to convince Sarah it was a good idea to go for a walk, despite the fact by now it was getting colder and dark.


Clapham Common is large park not far from where I live in Balham, in the centre there's a restored bandstand from 1890; this is the spot I'd chosen to propose. There were several distractions for Sarah on the way, shops full of interesting trinkets and an old lady feeding the geese and ducks around the pond. My impatience was surely showing at this point as it got darker by the minute - this was not going as I'd envisioned!


Finally we got close to the bandstand and as casually as I could, I said "let's go over here" and then "let's go inside". Once we got to the centre, I panicked realising the one thing I hadn't considered is what I'd say. I hugged her and when she asked why we were here I said "because this is where I'm going to ask you to marry me" then got down on one knee and offered Sarah the ring...


Which was about 6 sizes too big.
