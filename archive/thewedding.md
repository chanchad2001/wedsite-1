We'll be getting married in Sarah's home town of Binghamton, NY on September 19th at 1 o'clock in [Saints John & Andrew Church](https://goo.gl/maps/g1EJx) the ceremony will be followed at 3o'clock by a reception at the nearby [DoubleTree By Hilton](https://goo.gl/maps/Ryfg9). These are the same venues Sarah's parents used in their wedding :)

We've got a limited number of twin rooms at a special rate at the [DoubleTree Hilton](http://doubletree3.hilton.com/en/hotels/new-york/doubletree-by-hilton-hotel-binghamton-BGMWSDT/index.html) if you'd like to book one of these rooms or would like help with travel [let us know](mailto:us@khalandsarah.com).

Spending the day with family and friends is genuinely the best gift we could ask for. We do not have a wedding registry, however any gifts are welcome including the option to contribute to our honeymoon adventure next year in Peru, South America.
