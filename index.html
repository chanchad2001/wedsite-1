	<h1>Welcome</h1>
	<p>Khal & Sarah first met in Dublin, Ireland on March 30th, 2013 in an Irish pub. From the beginning Khal knew Sarah was a special girl worth fighting for. After a few dates in London their love grew. Sarah was the first to say “I love you” on her Birthday, April 26th, 2013.</p>
	<p>From there, Khal and Sarah traveled to 7 countries together while battling the long distance from New York to London. On Sarah’s recent trip to London... she said “yes” on February 11th, 2015.</p> 
	<p>Please join us in Binghamton, NY September 19th, 2015 to be part of our new adventure!
