Khal & Sarah first met in Dublin, Ireland on March 30th, 2013 in an Irish pub. From the beginning Khal knew Sarah was a special girl worth fighting for. After a few dates in London their love grew. Sarah was the first to say “I love you” on her Birthday, April 26th, 2013.
	
From there, Khal and Sarah traveled to 7 countries together while battling the long distance from New York to London. On Sarah’s recent trip to London... she said “yes” on February 11th, 2015.
